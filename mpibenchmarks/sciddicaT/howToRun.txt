1. Update the "cluster" file according to system configuration and domain decomposition.
For instance:

610 496
2
127.0.0.1 2 
0 0 153
0 1 152
127.0.0.1 1
0 0 305 

The first line (640 496) reppresents the domain dimensions in term of rows and columns, respectively.
The second line (2) identifies the number of MPI processes to be run.
The third line (127.0.0.1 1) the IP and number of devices.
The fourth line (0 0 153) the number of platform, the number of device and the number of row.
The fifth line (0 0 152) the number of platform, the number of device and the number of row.
The sixth line (127.0.0.1 1) the IP and number of devices.
The seventh line (0 0 305) the number of platform, the number of device and the number of row.

2. run the following script with the created cluster file and the executable. 
./opencalexec_v2.sh cluster ./build/calclmpi_sciddicaT
